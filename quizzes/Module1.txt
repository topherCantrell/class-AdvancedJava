;Overview    
A thread doesn't need CPU time when it is _____.   
    *waiting ^ also called "blocked"
    thrashing   
    joining 
    forking 
                
Java limits you to creating at most 50 threads. 
    *FALSE ^ there is no fixed limit 
                
A computer with multiple CPUs is said to be multi _____.    
    *core    
    threaded    
    functional  
    dimensional 
                
In order to run multiple processes on your computer you must have multiple cores.   
    *FALSE ^ a single cpu can time-slice between multiple threads
                
A _____ occurs when two threads are waiting on each other.  
    *deadlock    
    join    
    race condition  
    Break Exception 
                
;Basics  
Pick the correct thread "run" method:   
    *public void run() ^ Use @Override and the compiler will check you
    protected int run() 
    static void run()   
    public void runnable()  
                
The "run" method is defined in the _____ interface. 
    *Runnable    
    Thread  
    EntryPoint  
    System  
                
You start a new thread by calling the "run" method. 
    *FALSE ^  You must go through the thread controller  
                
This class acts as a controller for a single thread:    
    *Thread  
    Runnable    
    ThreadMgr   
    Controller  
                
A thread automatically stops when it returns from its "run" method. 
    *TRUE     
                
When does the JVM stop running: 
    *When all threads have ended 
    When "main" comes to an end 
    Only when you call "exit"   
    When all threads are blocked    
                
A thread's priority is fixed when the thread is created.    
    *FALSE ^  You can raise and lower a thread's priority through its controller  
                
The _____ function pauses the current thread for a requested amount of time.    
    *sleep   
    pause   
    hold    
    yield   
                
The _____ method has been deprecated. You should not call it.  
    *stop ^   You should ask a thread to end itself
    interrupt   
    exit    
    yield   
                
The "sleep" method may generate this checked exception:
    *InterruptedException    
    NullPointerException    
    RuntimeError    
    SleepViolation  
                
;Exclusion   
Each thread has its own _____.  
    *stack   
    CPU 
    heap    
    virtual machine 
                
It is possible to limit a section of code to just one thread. 
    *TRUE                
                
The ReentrantLock has been with Java since the beginning.   
     *FALSE ^  It was added in 1.5             
                
How many times can a single thread acquire the same ReentrantLock?  
    *No limit ^  That's why it is called "reentrant"
    Just once   
    Twice   
    Once per CPU    
                
Before the lock objects were added there was no threading in Java.  
    *FALSE ^  Threading was built into java from the start
                
The "synchronized" keyword takes one parameter: 
    *the object to lock  
    the lock count  
    a boolean   
    the number of seconds to wait   
                
You may use "synchronize" to guard an entire function.  
    *TRUE       
                
Use the _____ method to sleep until a target thread ends.   
    *join    
    wait    
    yield   
    synchronized    
                
These two methods are paired together:  
    *await/signal ^  The other pair is "wait/notify"
    wait/signal 
    yield/notify    
    sleep/signal    
                
This type of object is created by a lock's "newCondition" method:   
    *Condition   
    Monitor 
    Sync    
    Thread  
                
You must own the "lock" before you can call "await" or "notify".    
    *TRUE    
                
These threading methods have been built into java from the start:   
    *synchronized, wait, notify  ^ These are part of the Object base class for all objects
    lock, unlock, await, signal 
    run, signal, yield, unlock  
    await, notify   
                
This construct allows us to reuse threads instead of creating and destroying them on the fly.   
    *Thread Pool 
    Thread Collection   
    Executive   
    RecycleBin  
                
;JNI 
The body of a _____ method is written in platform-specific code.    
    *native  
    protected   
    system  
    syncrhonized    
                
You can mix native and pure-java methods in the same class. 
    *TRUE       
                
Native methods are often used when you need:    
    *all of the above    
    access to hardware  
    to use existing code    
    high performance    
                
You can use the same native code for every platform.    
    *FALSE ^  Each platform has its own set of native instructions  
                
This JDK tool automatically creates C/C++ header files: 
    *javah   
    jnih    
    javac   
    nativeh 
                
The "loadLibrary" method requires the complete name of the native shared library.   
    *FALSE ^  You do NOT specify the file extension
                
You cannot pass parameters to a native method.  
    *FALSE      
                
Your native code can create object in the calling JVM.  
    *TRUE ^  Native code can do everything pure-java code can  
                
Your native code has access to the "this" pointer.  
    *TRUE  ^  It is passed to the native function
                
;Misc    
Code that is prepared to handle multiple threads is called: 
    *thread-safe 
    a java bean 
    synchronized    
    multi-core  
            
Two threads can walk on each others' local variables.   
    *FALSE 
                
The "new" lock objects allow you to request priority _____. 
    *fairness ^ This is just a suggestion ... not a demand.
    inversion   
    control 
    shipping
