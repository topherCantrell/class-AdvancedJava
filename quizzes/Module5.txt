     AWT

The 'M' in MVC stands for:
     *Model
     Machine
     Meta
     Modern

     *TRUE


;16

You add JMenuBar elements directly to a:
     *JFrame
      JMenu
      JPanel

You can add JMenu objects to JMenu objects to create multi-level menus.
     *TRUE

;18

This layout manager does not resize its components at all:
     *JFlowLayout
     JGridLayout
     JBorderLayout
     JPanel

This layout manager resizes components to fit in a two dimensional grid.
     *JGridLayout
     JBorderLayout
     JFlowLayout
     JTableLayout

;20

A container can be used as a component inside another container.
     *TRUE ^ You nest containers to build a desired layout

This component wraps another component in scroll bars:
     *JScrollPane
     JPanel
     JScrollable
     JBar

This attribute is the natural size of a component if unchanged by a layout manager:
     *Preferred Size
     Location
     Current Size
     Bounds

;23

This method call will prevent a JFrame from being resized by the user:
     *setResizable(false)
     setFixedSize(true)
     pack()
     setSize(0,0)

This method sets the JFrame's content area:
     *setContentPane()
     setContainer()
     add()
     pack()

The "add" method is part of the _____ interface:
     *Container
     Layout Manager ^ Containers hold the components. The layout managers size them.

     Component

To add a border you must create an instance of BorderFactory.

;27
To add a new tab to the JTabbedPane you call:

To create a split between a left component and a right component use:
     *JSplitPane.HORIZONTAL_SPLIT
     JSplitPane.VERTICAL_SPLIT
     JTabbedPane
     GridLayout

;29
You must implement the _____ interface to catch events from a JButton.

     Runnable

The _____ method attaches a listener to a JButton.
     *addActionListener()
     setActionEvent()
     setButtonHandler()
     addClickHandler()

The default behavior for the methods in MouseListener is to "do nothing".
     *FALSE ^ You must override all methods in an interface even you don't need them

;32

     *TRUE

The JTextField component calls your _____ listener when the ENTER key is pressed.
